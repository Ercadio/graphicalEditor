## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to start the app.

## Viewing the Application

```
$ polymer serve
```

## Building the Application

```
$ polymer build
```

This will create builds of the application in the `build/` directory, optimized to be served in production. You can then serve the built versions directly:

```
$ polymer serve build/default
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```
